# Titanic_survival_analysis
This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using Machine Learning techniques. It is one of the most popular beginner projects in data science, widely available on Kaggle Titanic Dataset.

📌 Project Overview
The goal is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as:
Age
Gender
Passenger Class (Pclass)
Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket fare
Cabin & Embarkation point

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas – data manipulation
NumPy – numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization
Scikit-Learn – machine learning models & evaluation

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
Explored survival distribution by gender, class, and family size
Visualized relationships using bar plots, heatmaps, and histograms

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
✅ Best performing model: Random Forest Classifier with f1 score of 0.8.
